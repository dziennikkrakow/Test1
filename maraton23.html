<h2>  Insights </h2>

<p > <font size="3">
The very good idea was to start marathon early 7.30 -9 a.m. due to several reasons.
<br>
It is worth considering for next runs which are planned for the future.
It showed that early starting is possible and organisable.
It allows to run in lower tempretures which limits dehydration and reduces impact on the city. </font> 
<br>
Also teh route should be considered and diverted to passges which allow to cross it by cars pedestrians or riders.
In teh current form it cut of form Blonia to nowa Huta with limited or not possible way to pass it through.
<br>
The discussion with abroad participants put attention to water, which wasbottled but by some found as "not tatesy".
Due to minority of such comments it may be considered as personal preferences more than a real problem.
